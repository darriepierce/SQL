--This is a projetc where I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
--Then I created a table and inserted the Spotify data.
--Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

--Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
(id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL)


--SpotifyData Table queries:

--Which artist has the most popular song?
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 1

--Which artistâ€™s song has the most danceability?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability DESC
LIMIT 1

--How many songs does each artist have in the database?
SELECT artist_name, COUNT (*)
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY count(*) DESC

--Find the longest song and who is the artist.
SELECT duration_ms, track_name, artist_name
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY DESC
LIMIT 1
